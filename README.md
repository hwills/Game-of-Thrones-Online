#Game of Thrones Online
This is an implementation of the Game of Thrones Boardgame made for local play online. It was developed by myself and Nana Owusu (nowusu@wustl.edu) over the course of a week. This project was created completely with JavaScript, JQuery, html, css, and Bootstrap. For future expansion on this game, we would implement this using node and sockets so players can challenge each other from different machines.
Designed to work best in Chrome.
